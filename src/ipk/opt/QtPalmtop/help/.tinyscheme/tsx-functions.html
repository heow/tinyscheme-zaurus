<code>(load-extension "tsx")</code>

<h3>TSX FUNCTIONS</h3>

TSX incorporates the following functions:<p>

<code>(make-client-socket host port)</code><br>
        host: string (IP address or host name)<br>
        port: integer number<br><br>

        Returns a socket which is already connected to the
        specified host and port, or #f if the connection could
        not be performed.<p>

<code>(make-server-socket port)</code><br>
        port: integer number<br><br>

        Returns a socket which is bound to the specified port on
        the local machine, and ready to accept connections. If the
        socket could not be created (e.g., because the port is
        already in use, or it is a privileged port and the user has
        no permissions on it), #f is returned.<p>

<code>(recv! sock buff)</code><br>
        sock: socket obtained with make-client-socket or accept<br>
        buff: string<br><br>

        Waits for received data through the specified socket, and
        stores it on the buffer. The return value indicates the
        number of received bytes. This call blocks until some data
        is received, but does not guarantee that buff gets
        completely filled. If an error occurs (e.g., the other
        peer disconnects) then #f is returned.<p>

<code>(recv-new-string sock)</code><br>
        sock: socket obtained with make-client-socket or accept<br><br>

        Waits for received data through the specified socket, and
        returns it in a new string. This call blocks until some
        data is received. If an error occurs, then #f is returned.<p>

<code>(send sock buff)</code><br>
        sock: socket obtained with make-client-socket or accept<br>
        buff: string<br><br>

        Sends the data contained in the string through the socket.
        It returns the number of transmitted bytes (could be
        different than the size of the string!), or #f if an error
        occured (e.g., the other peer disconnected).<p>

<code>(accept server-sock)</code><br>
        server-sock: socket obtained with make-server-socket<br><br>

        Waits until a connection is received on the specified
        server socket, and returns the connected socket. If an
        error occurs (e.g., the network interface shuts down), it
        returns #f instead.<p>

<code>(close-socket sock)</code><br>
        sock: socket obtained with make-server-socket,
              make-client-socket or accept<br><br>

	The socket is closed. No further calls should be performed
        on this socket.<p>

<code>(sock-is-data-ready? sock)</code><br>
        sock: socket obtained with make-server-socket,
              make-client-socket or accept<br><br>

	This function allows non-blocking operation with sockets.
	It returns #t if data is available for reception on this
	socket, and #f if no data has been received.<p>

<code>(sock-peek sock)</code><br>
        sock: socket obtained with make-server-socket,
              make-client-socket or accept<br><br>

	This function returns (as a newly created string) the
	data received in this socket. The information is not
	removed from the input queue.<p>


<h3>Filesystem Functions</h3>

Scheme already defines functions to read and write files. These
functions allow access to the filesystem to check if a certain
file exists, to get its size, etc.<p>

<code>(file-size filename)</code><br>
        filename: string<br><br>

        This function returns the size (in bytes) of the
        indicated file, or #f if the file does not exists or
        is not accessible to the requesting user.<p>

<code>(file-exists? filename)</code><br>
        filename: string<br><br>

        This function returns #t if the indicated file exists, and
        #f if it does not exists or it is not accessible to the
        requesting user.<p>

<code>(delete-file filename)</code><br>
        filename: string<br><br>

        Removes the specified file. It returns #t if the operation
        succeeds, or #f otherwise (e.g., because the file is
        read-only, or because the file does not exist).<p>

<code>(open-dir-stream path)</code><br>
        path: string<br><br>

        Opens a "directory stream" on the provided directory path.
        This stream will provide all the files within the directory,
        using the function read-dir-entry. The stream should be closed
        at the end with close-dir-stream.<p>

<code>(read-dir-entry dirstream)</code><br>
        dirstream: directory stream, obtained with open-dir-stream.<br><br>

        It returns the name of the following directory entry, or eof
        if all the entries were provided. Check the return value with
        with eof-object?.<p>

<code>(close-dir-stream dirstream)</code><br>
        dirstream: directory stream, obtained with open-dir-stream.<br><br>

        Close directory stream. No further calls to read-dir-entry should
        be performed.<p>


<h3>Time Functions</h3>

<code>(time)</code><br>
        Returns the current local time, as a list of integer
        containing:<br>
          (year month day-of-month hour min sec millisec)<br>
        The year is expressed as an offsett from 1900.<p>

<code>(gettimeofday)</code><br>
        Returns a list containing the number of seconds from
        the beginning of the day, and microseconds within the
        current second.<p>

<code>(usleep microsec)</code><br>
        microsec: integer<br><br>

        Suspends execution of the calling thread during the
        specified number of microseconds.<p>


<h3>Miscellaneous functions</h3>

<code>(getenv varname)</code><br>
        varname: string<br><br>

        Returns a string with the content of the specified
        environment variable, or #f if the variable is not
        defined.<p>

<code>(system command)</code><br>
        command: string<br><br>

        Executes a command on the /bin/sh shell. Returns #f if
        it is unable to run /bin/sh or another error occurs,
        or an integer return code which is the value returned
        by the command to the shell.<p>
