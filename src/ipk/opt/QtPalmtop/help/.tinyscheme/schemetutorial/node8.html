Procedures</A>
</H1>

<P>
Procedures in Scheme are first class, meaning that they can be passed
as arguments, bound to variables and returned as values from other
procedures.  Arguments are passed by value. Note that the order in
which the arguments are evaluated is not defined.  We shall now study
procedures in further detail.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00810000000000000000">
Recursion</A>
</H1>

<P>
Procedures which call themselves within the body of their lambda expression
are said to be recursive. In general, recursive procedures need a terminating
condition (otherwise they will run forever) and a recursive step (describing
how the computation should proceed).

<P>
We will use one of MzScheme's procedures <TT>trace</TT> to illustrate the
behaviour of recursive procedures. The procedure <TT>trace</TT> shows the
intermediate steps as the recursion proceeds as well as the intermediate
values returned.

<P>
For example, let us define a procedure for counting the factorial of a number.
We know that <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="0!"> equals 1 and we will use this as our terminating 
condition. Apart from that, we know that <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="n!"> is the same as <!-- MATH
 $n\cdot(n-1)!$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="n*(n-1)!">, 
which gives us our recursive step. We are now ready to define the procedure 
itself:
<PRE>
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)                  ; the terminating condition
        1                        ; returning 1
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))  ; the recursive step
</PRE>

<P>
Let' see what happens if we try to compute the factorial of 7 by using the
procedure <TT>trace</TT>:
<PRE>
&gt; (fact 7)
5040
&gt; (trace fact)
(fact)
&gt; (fact 7)
|(fact 7)
| (fact 6)
| |(fact 5)
| | (fact 4)
| | |(fact 3)
| | | (fact 2)
| | | |(fact 1)
| | | | (fact 0)
| | | | 1
| | | |1
| | | 2
| | |6
| | 24
| |120
| 720
|5040
5040
&gt; (untrace fact)
(fact)
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00811000000000000000">
Flat recursion</A>
</H2>

<P>
If the recursion is applied over the top-level items of a list it is said to
be flatly recursive. For example, if we have a list (1 2 (3 4)) then the top
level items are 1, 2 and (3 4).

<P>
Scheme provides a procedure <TT>append</TT>, which appends
the lists given as arguments. We will now define our own <I>append</I>
procedure, which will take two lists as arguments and return a list consisting
of these arguments. For example, if we have the lists (a b c) and (d e f),
our procedure <I>append</I> would return (a b c d e f) if these lists were
given as arguments. 

<P>
We start by trying to figure out how to append the lists.
Clearly, we need to find a way to attach the items of the latter list to the
items of the first list. We also need the procedures <TT>cons</TT>, 
<TT>car</TT> and <TT>cdr</TT>. To construct our list, we will need to 
build a new list containing the items. The first element of this list will be
the first element in the list (a b c) and the last elements will be the
elements in (d&nbsp;e&nbsp;f). Since (d&nbsp;e&nbsp;f) is a list, we can construct our list by
consing the elements of our first list with our second list. However, we still
need to pick out the elements of our first list, one at a time until it is
empty. By this we find our terminating condition: when the first list is empty,
return the second list. The second list will then be consed to the elements
of the list we are constructing, which at this point already contains all
the elements of the first list.
<PRE>
(define append
  (lambda (ls1 ls2)
    (if (null? ls1)
        ls2
        (cons (car ls1) (append (cdr ls1) ls2)))))
</PRE>

<P>
To see how this works, let's use <TT>trace</TT> and see what happens:
<PRE>
&gt; (trace append)
(append)
&gt; (append '(a b c) '(d e f))
|(append (a b c) (d e f))
| (append (b c) (d e f))
| |(append (c) (d e f))
| | (append () (d e f))
| | (d e f)
| |(c d e f)
| (b c d e f)
|(a b c d e f)
(a b c d e f)
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00812000000000000000">
Deep recursion</A>
</H2>

<P>
Deep recursion is recursion over all of the atomic items of a list structure, 
i.e. the procedure is applied to the <TT>car</TT> and <TT>cdr</TT> of a list. 
Deep
recursion is also referred to as tree recursion. We might have lists containing
other lists, e.g. (1 2 (3 4 5)). The list as a whole has nesting level 0,
whereas the top level items 1, 2 and (3 4 5) have the nesting level 1. 
For example, the element 3 in (1 2 (3 4 (5 (6 7)))) has nesting level 2, 
whereas the element 7 has nesting level 4.

<P>
Let's define a procedure for counting the number of atomic items in a list
structure.
If the list is empty, it contains 0 elements. If the list is not empty and
not a pair, it contains 1 element. Otherwise, it contains the number of 
elements in its <TT>car</TT> plus the number of elements in its <TT>cdr</TT>.
We are now ready to define our procedure (also found in SICP p. 109):
<PRE>
(define count-leaves
  (lambda (ls)
    (cond ((null? ls) 0)
          ((not (pair? ls)) 1)
          (else (+ (count-leaves (car ls))
                   (count-leaves (cdr ls)))))))
</PRE>

<P>
Let's see how <I>count-leaves</I> works:
<PRE>
&gt; (count-leaves '(1 2 3 4))
4
&gt; (count-leaves '(1 2 (3 4)))
4
&gt; (count-leaves '(1 2 (3 4 (5 6 (7 8) 9 (10 11)))))
11
</PRE>

<P>
To see the procedure calls and return tables of <I>count-leaves</I>, we use
the procedure <TT>trace</TT>:

<PRE>
&gt; (trace count-leaves)
(count-leaves)
&gt; (count-leaves '(a (b c (d e))))
|(count-leaves (a (b c (d e))))
| (count-leaves a)
| 1
| (count-leaves ((b c (d e))))
| |(count-leaves (b c (d e)))
| | (count-leaves b)
| | 1
| | (count-leaves (c (d e)))
| | |(count-leaves c)
| | |1
| | |(count-leaves ((d e)))
| | | (count-leaves (d e))
| | | |(count-leaves d)
| | | |1
| | | |(count-leaves (e))
| | | | (count-leaves e)
| | | | 1

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00813000000000000000">
Tail recursion</A>
</H2>

<P>
A recursive procedure executing an iterative process in constant space is 
said to be tail-recursive. In other words, instead of having to wait for the
computation of recursive procedure calls to return with a value needed, thus
having to construct return tables, we are able to define procedures which
save the state of a computation in a variable, which, when the terminating
condition is reached, will be returned as the final value of the procedure.
Iterative procedures are implemented by using tail recursion. This is actually
the most important feature to understand together with the fact that the
intermediate results of the computation will not be saved in a return table,
but in a variable that by the end of the computation will be returned as the
final result. Hence, the last thing that a tail-recursive procedure does 
before terminating is calling itself!

<P>
Let us take a look at the recursive as well as the iterative version of 
<I>factorial</I>:
<PRE>
;; The recursive version
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

;; The iterative version used in SICP p.33
(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (&gt; counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))

;; The iterative version using letrec, equivalent to the one in SICP
(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    (letrec ((iter
              (lambda (product counter)
                (if (&gt; counter n)
                    product        
                    (iter (* counter product)
                          (+ counter 1))))))
      (iter 1 1)))
</PRE>

<P>
What makes the latter procedure iterative is the fact that the variable 
<I>product</I> will be updated as the computation continues. When the final
condition is reached, <I>product</I> will be returned. The update is 
performed when the procedure is called--as you can see, the variable 
<I>product</I> is an argument (in this case the first) of <I>iter</I> and 
when <I>iter</I> is recursively called, it is called with the first 
argument being <TT>(*&nbsp;counter&nbsp;product)</TT>. If the final condition is reached 
at this point, this argument will be returned, otherwise another 
tail-recursive step  which updates the <I>product</I> will be taken. 

<P>
Tail recursion also differs from <I>normal</I> recursion by the fact that
the procedure called recursively will not be an argument of another procedure,
e.g. multiplication. The recursive step of the recursive <I>fact</I> is the
following: 
<PRE>
(* n (fact (- n 1))))))
</PRE>

<P>
The computation therefore needs to wait for each call to <I>fact</I> to
return, after which multiplication is applied. Tail recursion does not share
this wasteful defect. The recursive step of the iterative <I>fact</I> is
the following:

<P>
<PRE>
(iter (* counter product)
      (+ counter 1))))))
</PRE>

<P>
As we can see, <I>iter</I> calls itself recursively without being an 
argument to any other procedure, thus not needing to wait for any values to
return. It also saves the state of the computation by passing it as an 
argument and returning the current state as the final state  when the 
terminating condition is reached. 

<P>
Let's use <TT>trace</TT> and see the procedures <I>fact</I> and 
<I>factorial</I> in action:
<PRE>
;; We start with the recursive one
&gt; (trace fact)
(fact)
&gt; (fact 5)
|(fact 5)
| (fact 4)
| |(fact 3)
| | (fact 2)
| | |(fact 1)
| | | (fact 0)
| | | 1
| | |1
| | 2
| |6
| 24
|120
120

;; and compare this to the iterative one
&gt; (factorial 5)
|(factorial 5)
|120
120
</PRE>

<P>
Actually, the iterative version performs equally many calls, but the 
procedure <TT>trace</TT> does not show them. The following calls are made:
<PRE>
(iter 1 1)
(iter 1 2)
(iter 2 3)
(iter 6 4)
(iter 24 5)
(iter 120 6)

==&gt; 120
</PRE>

<P>
What <TT>trace</TT> does make clear is the fact that no return tables are
needed.

<P>
Even if tail recursive procedures are more efficient in most cases, they are 
not usually as straightforward to implement as recursive ones. It takes some
insight and some practice, but the reader is encouraged to try to figure out
how to write a recursive procedure tail-recursively. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00820000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="do"></A>
<BR>
The iteration construct do
</H1>
Scheme provides a rather complex iteration construct <TT>do</TT>
<A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot923"><SUP>6.1</SUP></A>, which specifies a set of variables to be bound, how
they are to  be initialized and how they are to be updated on each
iteration.

<P>
The syntax of <TT>do</TT> is the following:

<P>
<PRE>
(do ((var1 init1 step1)
     ...)
    (test expr ...)
  command ...)
</PRE>

<P>
First the <I>init</I> expressions are evaluated in some unspecified
order and the results are stored in the bindings of the variables
<I>var1...</I> After this the iteration can begin. First
<I>test</I> is evaluated. If
<I>test</I> is true, the following expressions are evaluated from left to
right and the value of the last <I>expr</I> is returned. The
iteration then terminates. If <I>test</I> evaluates to false, then
the <I>command</I> expressions are evaluated in  order for
effect. The <I>step</I> expressions are evaluated and the result is
stored in the variables <I>var1&nbsp;...</I>, which are bound to fresh
locations. The next iteration can now begin. Note that it is an error
for a  variable to occur more than once in the list of variables.

<P>
For example, the following expression binds the string ``foobar'' to the
variable <I>str</I> and the value 0 to the variable <I>i</I>. The variable
<I>i</I> will be increased by one for each iteration until <I>i</I> equals
the length of <I>str</I>. When this happens, <I>str</I> will be returned,
otherwise the character at index <I>i</I> in <I>str</I> will be set to
the character&nbsp;<I>b</I>.

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; (do ((str (string #\f #\o #\o #\b #\a #\r))
       (i 0 (+ i 1)))
      ((= i (string-length str)) str)
    (string-set! str i #\b))
"bbbbbb"
</PRE>
