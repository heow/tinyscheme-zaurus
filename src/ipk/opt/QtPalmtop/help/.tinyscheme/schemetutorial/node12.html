<H1><A NAME="SECTION001200000000000000000">
Input and output</A>
</H1>

<P>
Output can be written to a file or to the screen and input can be read
either from a file or from the keyboard. 

<P>
We might want to print out other data than just the final result of a
computation. For example, we might want to print out intermediate results
as a means of debugging our programs if they don't behave as they should.
Scheme provides a couple of procedures for handling input, output and the
ports related to the issue.

<P>
If we want to write to the screen we can use the procedures <TT>display</TT> or
<TT>write</TT>. There is also a procedure <TT>newline</TT> for printing and
end of line.

<P>
The procedure <TT>display</TT> is called with one argument, which it prints
to the screen as a side effect, returning an unspecified value. For example:
<PRE>
(define square 
  (lambda (x) 
    (* x x)))

(define test
  (lambda ()
    (begin
      (display "Scheme is great: ")
      (display (square 2))
      (newline))))
   
&gt; (test) 
Scheme is great: 4
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <TT>display</TT> should never be used just to print out the value 
returned by
a procedure. It is only a tool for writing additional information on the 
screen. For example, let's look at how to write the procedure <I>square</I>
and how not to:
<PRE>
(define square
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x)))

(define horror-square
  (lambda (x)
    (let ((result (* x x)))
      (begin 
        (display result)
        (newline)))))
</PRE>

<P>
Now, let's see them both in action:
<PRE>
&gt; (square 5)
25
&gt; (horror-square 5)
25
&gt; (define a (square 5))
&gt; a
25
&gt; (define b (horror-square 5))
25
&gt; b
&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
What happened was that <I>square</I> behaved as we expected it to, but
<I>horror-square</I> behaves completely differently. They both print out
the expected result when called directly, however, the result printed by
<I>square</I> was a return value, whereas the result printed by 
<I>horror-square</I> was caused by a side effect. The return value of the
procedure <I>horror-square</I> is unspecified. Trying to bind the result of
the procedure <I>square</I> to a variable works fine and the
variable can be used later on. Trying the same using <I>horror-square</I>
will clearly not work as we might wish. Hence, you cannot really use 
<I>horror-square</I> to anything else than printing out the square of its
argument--it can never be called by another procedure needing the
square of a number. Say goodbye to reusability, modularity and good
programming style!  Therefore, don't ever use <TT>display</TT> to
print out values that should be  return values! The same applies to
<TT>write</TT> or any other procedure  causing side effects.

<P>
<TT>Write</TT> is almost like <TT>display</TT>, but strings that are in the 
written representation are enclosed in double quotes:

<P>
<PRE>
(define test2
  (lambda ()
    (begin
      (write "Scheme is great: ")
      (write (square 2))
      (newline))))

&gt; (test2)
"Scheme is great: "4
</PRE>

<PRE>
&gt; (begin
    (display "foobar")
    (newline))
foobar
&gt; (begin
    (write "foobar")
    (newline))
"foobar"
</PRE>

<P>
The procedure <TT>write</TT> is usually used together with the procedure
<TT>read</TT>. Note that if you write something using <TT>write</TT> and then
read the output of <TT>write</TT> using <TT>read</TT>, then you obtain the
same thing that you wrote. The procedure <TT>write</TT> produces a written
representation of its argument and is meant for producing machine readable
output, whereas <TT>display</TT> is meant for producing human readable output.

<P>
Scheme also provides a couple of procedures for reading from the
keyboard.  The procedure <TT>read</TT> returns the value of the next
parsable object that is entered on the keyboard.  For example, let's
write a procedure that reads input from the keyboard using
<TT>read</TT> and then prints out the type of argument together with the 
argument:
<PRE>
(define blopp
  (lambda ()
    (let ((a (read)))
      (cond ((number? a) (show "Number" a))
            ((char? a) (show "Character" a))
            ((string? a) (show "String" a))
            ((symbol? a) (show "Symbol" a))
            ((list? a) (show "List" a))
            (else (show "Unknown type" a)))
      (blopp)))

(define show
  (lambda (type arg)
    (begin
      (display type)
      (display ": ")
      (display arg)
      (newline))))
</PRE>

<P>
The procedure works in the following way:
<PRE>
&gt; (blopp)
5
Number: 5
#\a
Character: a
"foobar"
String: foobar
b
Symbol: b
(1 2 3 4)
List: (1 2 3 4)
#(1 2 3 4)
Unknown type: #(1 2 3 4)
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION001210000000000000000">
Input and output to files</A>
</H1>

<P>
What was left unmentioned in the previous section was that the data read came
from an input port and the data written was sent to an output port. Ports
are Scheme objects associated with input and output devices, the standard
input being the keyboard and the standard output being the screen by default.
It is also possible to associate ports with files. This is done with the
Scheme procedures <TT>open-input-file</TT> and <TT>open-output-file</TT>. Both
take one argument, namely the name of the file to be opened, e.g.

<P>
<PRE>
&gt;(open-input-file "test.txt")
</PRE>

<P>
Ports can be closed with <TT>close-input-port</TT> and 
<TT>close-output-port</TT>, which both take the port
as an argument, e.g.
<PRE>
(define p (open-input-file "test.txt"))

...

(close-input-port p)
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose that we want to read data from a file <I>testdata.txt</I>. What we
need to do is open an input port associated to the file to be read and assign
it to a variable <I>p</I>. We also need a procedure to read the data.
We can use the procedure <TT>read</TT> that was mentioned in the previous 
section by providing it with one extra argument, namely the input port 
<I>p</I>. 
Say that our file contains the following:
<PRE>
Scheme is fun!
((a b) (1 2))
</PRE>

<P>
Let's now read the contents of that file:
<PRE>
&gt; (define p (open-input-file "testdata.txt"))
&gt; (read p)
scheme
&gt; (read p)
is
&gt; (read p)
fun!
&gt; (read p)
((a b) (1 2))
&gt; (read p)
#&lt;eof&gt;
&gt; (close-input-port p)
&gt; (read p)
#&lt;primitive:get-port-char&gt;: input port is closed
&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Scheme also provides a procedure <TT>eof-object?</TT>, which has the following
syntax:
<PRE>
(eof-object? obj)
</PRE>

<P>
If <I>obj</I> is an end of file object, then <TT>#t</TT> will be returned,
otherwise <TT>#f</TT> will be returned. The procedures <TT>read</TT>,
<TT>read-char</TT> and <TT>peek-char</TT> return an eof object when they 
encounter the end of the file they are reading.  

<P>
The procedure <TT>char-ready?</TT> has the following syntax:
<PRE>
(char-ready? port)
</PRE>

<P>
The <I>port</I> may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the value
returned by <TT>current-input-port</TT>. The procedure <TT>char-ready?</TT>
returns <TT>#t</TT> if a character is ready on the input port, otherwise it
returns <TT>#f</TT>. If <TT>#t</TT> is returned, then it is guaranteed that
the next <TT>read-char</TT> operation on the given port will not hang. 

<P>
There is also a procedure <TT>read-char</TT> that reads and returns the 
following character available. If no characters are available, an end of file
object will be returned. The procedure <TT>peek-char</TT> is almost like
<TT>read-char</TT>, but it does not update the port (more on ports will follow)
to point to the next character. Hence, <TT>read-char</TT> and 
<TT>peek-char</TT> will return the same character the first time they are 
called, but on the next call to <TT>peek-char</TT> the same value will be
returned as from the previous call. For example, let's see how 
<TT>read-char</TT> and <TT>peek-char</TT> work:
<PRE>
&gt; (define in (open-input-file "testdata.txt"))
&gt; (read-char in)
#\S
&gt; (read-char in)
#\c
&gt; (read-char in)
#\h
&gt; (read-char in)
#\e
&gt; (read-char in)
#\m
&gt; (read-char in)
#\e

&gt; (define peek-in (open-input-file "testdata.txt"))
&gt; (peek-char peek-in)
#\S
&gt; (peek-char peek-in)
#\S
&gt; (read-char peek-in)
#\S
&gt; (read-char peek-in)
#\c
&gt; (peek-char peek-in)
#\h
</PRE>

<P>
To write to a file we need to associate an output port with a file. This is
done in the following way:

<P>
<PRE>
(open-output-file "test.txt")
</PRE>

<P>
We can also assign the port returned from the expression above to a variable:

<P>
<PRE>
(define p (open-output-file "test.txt"))
</PRE>

<P>
The port is usually opened within a procedure, in which case <TT>let</TT>
should be used instead of <TT>define</TT>:
<PRE>
(let ((p (open-output-file "test.txt")))
  body)
</PRE>

<P>
If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, the
behaviour is implementation dependent. The old file might be deleted and a new
one created. 

<P>
The procedure <TT>with-output-to-file</TT> can also be used to write to files,
for example, let's write a procedure which writes a list to a file so that
each item of the list is followed by a newline:

<P>
<PRE>
(define display-list 
  (lambda (ls)
    (if (null? ls)
        (newline)
        (begin
          (display (car ls))
          (newline)
          (display-list (cdr ls))))))

(define write-list-to-file 
  (lambda (filename ls)
    (with-output-to-file filename
      (lambda ()
        (display-list ls)))))
</PRE>

<P>
Let's see an example:
<PRE>
&gt; (write-list-to-file "testfile.tmp" '(this is a test!))
</PRE>

<P>
The file we wrote to now looks like this:
<PRE>
this
is
a
test!
</PRE>

<P>
There are various procedures for writing to and reading from files. For more
